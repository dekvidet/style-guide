# Dekvidet JavaScript, React, Redux and Project Style Guide

The goal of this style guide is to give opinionated suggestions on code style. It is compiling, building on top of and extending already existing style guides.

While this style guide aims to be usable by itself it is also a guide for creating custom style guides. Feel free to fork, edit and customize it to your own needs.
